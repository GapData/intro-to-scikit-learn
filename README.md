__Abstract:__ Scikit-learn is an actively developed Python package providing an implementation of many machine learning algorithms. Scikit-learn is great for a number of reasons: it implements a large number of algorithms, it provides a consistent API across a algorithms that allows for rapid development, Python is general purpose language and can be used for building @@@@

In this talk, I will focus on Scikit-learn (and Python) as a tool for solving data problems from start to finish, from data preprocessing to model selection to model evaluation.
