__Abstract:__ Scikit-learn is an actively developed Python package providing an implementation of many machine learning algorithms. However, the benefits of Scikit-learn goes well beyond carefully implemented learning algorithms. Being built in Python, it allows easy integration with countless other Python modules for tasks such as plotting, data munging, and application development. Its consistent API across algorithms allows for rapid experimentation with multiple learning methods. Scikit-learn is well documented and provides lots of examples.

Instead of discussing particular machine learning algorithms provided by the package, I will focus on Scikit-learn (and Python) as a tool for solving data problems from start to finish, from data preprocessing to model selection to model evaluation. I will emphasize the Pipeline tool which allows the user to chain together all the steps of preprocessing and model fitting.
